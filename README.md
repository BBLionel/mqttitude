# MQTTitude

MQTTitude is an [Android] and [iOS] app
which allows a device to periodically publish its location status to an [MQTT]
broker. If you've previously used Google Latitude, you can think of this as a a
_decentralized Google Latitude_. MQTTitude was started because Google Latitude
was de-comissioned in August 2013.
