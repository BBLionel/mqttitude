# iOS Friends

The _Friends_ feature in the iOS MQTTitude app shows publishes seen on the same broker.

Tapping on one of the friends, performs a reverse geo-coding to show address. Furthermore, a click on the little right-arrow shows the last 5? locations.

It's difficult to remember which MQTT topic belongs to which friend, so we can associate a topic with an image of the friend as contained in the iOS address book:

Select an entry:

Address book opens. Select the entry you want to associate with the MQTTitude topic. In this
example, I choose Kate Bell:

We're back in MQTTitude, and we see the picture from the addressbook.
